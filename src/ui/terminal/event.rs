//! Event handling for the terminal emulator.
//!
//! This module bridges alacritty's event system with GPUI by providing
//! [`GpuiEventProxy`], which implements alacritty's [`EventListener`] trait
//! and forwards relevant events through a channel.
//!
//! # Event Flow
//!
//! ```text
//! alacritty Term → GpuiEventProxy → mpsc channel → TerminalView
//!                        │
//!                        └─ Translates Event enum to TerminalEvent
//! ```
//!
//! # Supported Events
//!
//! | Alacritty Event | TerminalEvent | Description |
//! |-----------------|---------------|-------------|
//! | `Event::Wakeup` | `Wakeup` | Terminal has new content |
//! | `Event::Bell` | `Bell` | BEL character received |
//! | `Event::Title(_)` | `Title(String)` | Title escape sequence (OSC 0/2) |
//! | `Event::ClipboardStore(_, _)` | `ClipboardStore(String)` | Copy request (OSC 52) |
//! | `Event::ClipboardLoad(_, _)` | `ClipboardLoad` | Paste request |
//! | `Event::Exit` | `Exit` | Terminal exited |
//! | `Event::ChildExit(_)` | `Exit` | Child process exited |
//! | `Event::ResetTitle` | `Title("")` | Reset to empty title |
//!
//! Events like `MouseCursorDirty`, `PtyWrite`, and `CursorBlinkingChange` are
//! ignored as they're handled internally or not needed for GPUI integration.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::sync::mpsc::channel;
//! use gpui_terminal::event::{GpuiEventProxy, TerminalEvent};
//!
//! let (tx, rx) = channel();
//! let proxy = GpuiEventProxy::new(tx);
//!
//! // The proxy is passed to alacritty's Term and will forward events
//! // Events can be received on the other end of the channel
//! ```
//!
